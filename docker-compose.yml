# Usage notes:
# - Start RabbitMQ: `docker compose up -d`
# - Verify: `docker ps` and http://localhost:15672 (guest/guest)
# - Run services locally (recommended):
#     cd booking-service && ./mvnw spring-boot:run
#     cd notification-service && ./mvnw spring-boot:run
#   Both services will connect to RabbitMQ at localhost:5672.
# - If you prefer containerized services, I can add service entries
#   that build each Spring Boot module into images and start them
#   together with RabbitMQ. Tell me if you want that.
